Look in the documentation for string.h (string.txt) to understand libUseful strings



int IPGeoLocate(char *IP, ListNode *Vars);

Pass in an quad-format IP address or a hostname, and this function will do geolocation and return the information as a list that holds strings. Look into list.txt to understand libUseful lists.




char *ExtractFromWebpage(char *RetStr, char *URL, char *ExtractStr, int MinLength);

This is a function for screen-scraping data items from webpages. 

example:

 RetStr=ExtractFromWebpage(RetStr,"http://checkip.dyndns.org", "Current IP Address: $(extract_item)</body>",4);

pass in a blank string as the first argument, and the function will print it's results into it and return it. The second argument is the URL of the web-page to get. The third argument is a string to search for, and clip out that part of the string that is here represented by '$(extract_item)'.
