/*

The STREAM object and its functions is the main means of accessing files and network resources in libUseful. 

STREAMOpen returns a stream object and takes two arguments, a URL and a 'Config' argument

//for example

S=STREAMOpen("/tmp/myfile.txt", "w");

The first argument can be any of the following types:

/tmp/myfile.txt                          file
mmap:/tmp/myfile.txt                     memory mapped file
tty:/dev/ttyS0:38400                     open a serial device, in this case at 38400 baud
udp:192.168.2.1:53                       udp network connection
tcp:192.168.2.1:25                       tcp network connection
ssl:192.168.2.1:443                      tcp network connection with encryption
tls:192.168.2.1:443                      tcp network connection with encryption
unix:/tmp/socket                         unix socket
unixdgram:/tmp/socket                    unix datagram socket
http:user:password@www.google.com        http network connection
https:www.google.com                     https network connection
cmd:cat /etc/hosts                       run command 'cat /etc/hosts' and read/write to/from it
ssh:192.168.2.1:1022/cat /etc/hosts      ssh connect, running the command 'cat /etc/hosts'


The 'config' argument has different meanings for some of the different URL types.

For files and http the config argument is a string of characters each of which represents an option 
that modifies stream behavior, as with 'fopen'

c     create file
r     read only
w     write only
a     append 
+     make read-only, append or write-only be read-write
E     raise an error if this file fails to open
F     follow symlinks. Without this flag an error is raised when a symlink is opened.
l     lock/unlock file on each read
L     lock/unlock file on each write
i     allow this file to be inherited across an exec (default is close-on-exec)
t     make a unique temporary file name. the file path must be a mktemp style template, with the last six characters being 'XXXXXX'
S     file contents are sorted
z     compress/uncompress with gzip

for 'http' and 'https' URLs the first argument is a haracter list (though only one character long) with the following values

r    GET method (default if no method specified)
w    POST method
W    PUT method
D    DELETE method
P    PATCH method
H    HEAD  method

after this initial argument come name-value pairs with the following values

oauth=<oauth config to use>
content-type=<content type>
content-length=<content length>
user=<username>
useragent=<user agent>
user-agent=<user agent>
hostauth

Note, 'hostauth' is not a name/value pair, just a config flag that enables sending authentication without waiting for a 401 Response from the server. This means that we can't know the authentication realm for the server, and so internally use the hostname as the realm for looking up logon credentials. This is mostly useful for the github api.


For 'cmd' type URLs the config options are those detailed in "SpawnPrograms.h"
For 'tty' type URLs the config options are those detailed in "Pty.h" for "TTYConfigOpen"
