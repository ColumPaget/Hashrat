//the mount commnd (see 'man 2 mount').

//perform 'lazy unmounts', which mark the mount point for unmount if it's busy and carry out the

//File system extended attributes support. This allows storing values in the file system against a filename.

//'trusted' attributes are only available to programs with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (this usually means
//only programs running as root) 'user' attributes are accessible by all users.
